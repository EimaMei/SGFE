TODO (in no particular order):
- README.md guide on creating a console backend.
- Document all macros.
- (3DS) Resize event.
- (3DS) Fix flicker when opening standard buffer.
- Update Makefiles to be better, have a 'compile_examples' command.
- (3DS) Add debug info for initialized and freed context.
- Document all examples.
- Finish the callbacks example with video mode change callback.
- Document examples/README.md
- Add changes from Desktop to Embedded
- add a gyro example.
- (3DS) Add anti-aliasing for OpenGL.
- (3DS) Update GLASS, libctru and other 3ds dependencies.
- (3DS) Add documentation for OpenGL support and how it requires GLASS and a forked
version of libctru.
- (3DS) Implement 'GSPGPU_SetLcdForceBlack' using the "showWindow" functions. Add
back the window flags for it.
- Implement a show flag.
- Add an example where the "non-primary" screen is only used.
- Add a sizeof and getters/setters for each opaque struct type.
- Rework debug systems to be more flexible. Remove SGFE_sendDebugInfo.
- swapInterval example
- Add timestamp to events.
- Controller battery event (battery update, dead, etc).
- Document all SGFE_<PLATFORM> macros.
- Linked list for controllers.
- Add a "end poll" event and function.
- (Wii) GameCube controller support.
- Add a controller event that'd notify the user of specific events. For wii it'd be adding/removing extensions to the wii remote.
- (3DS) Add an error if the users selects SGFE_videoModeWide on non 3DS and New 2DS XL consoles.
- Get region (NTSC/PAL?) function.
- Get cable function.
- Add a window flag to use native mode instead.
- Make "setNative" alloc non-native buffers if false is specified and buffers are null.
- (Wii) Fix bug where nunchuk controllers are eligible for gyroscope support.
- (Wii) Add video refresh event.
- (3DS) Add video refresh event.
- Remove swapBuffers in the callbacks example and replace it with a video fresh event:
	- notes on implementing it: use a callback for when VSync must on. Set a boolean,
	then in the pollEvenets function call 'refresh'. See if you have to wait a frame
	after vsync or if this can be done instantaneously
- Add rumble functionality.
- Create a screenshot of SGFE working on Wii and 3DS emulators/real hardware.
- In the "free window" function call a "hide window" function that turns the screen
black. Remove that kind of code from the 3DS code.
- Make platform-specific SGFE_buttonFromAPI/ToAPI functions available as platform functions.
- (3DS) replace "hidScanInput" with raw events.
- (Wii) add keyboard support. Add TextInput support for it.
- (Wii) add mouse support.
- (3DS) add virtual software keyboard support.
- Add options to disable app termination/loss of focus.
- Implement new ways of settings/getting opengl hints.

Maybe:
- (3DS) Find a way to not use gfxInitDefault for GLASS.
- OpenGL hint to request specific values instead of relying on minimums.
- SGFE_window_swapInterval for buffer rendering.
- Knob?
- Add angle to sensor.
- Replace wpad code with wiiuse.
- (Wii) Add a "fade out" effect when exiting.
- Make an SDL-style library that'd combine SGFE and RGFW.
- (Wii) White/black/red/blue Wiis as "system models"? Or maybe base it on this: https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2650/~/what-is-the-difference-between-the-models-of-wii-consoles%3F
- Make private API functions visible in the platform section.
- Implement a SDL_StartTextInput?/SDL_TextInputEvent.
- UIApplicationMain & example.
- Make a CHANGELOG

Distant TODO:
- Create a portable stdout/stderr library that'd write the text on screen.

Planned backends:
- Dreamcast (later on, maybe)

Console library TODO:
- Create a console structure that creates its own context and renders on top of the user output.
- Make it creatable/independent of SGFE_window and of createWindow init function.
- use the system font if possible.

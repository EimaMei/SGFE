Features:
- add adaptive vsync to buffer (check out lag via unoptimized standard.c)
- controllerListGetAvailable
- Add changes from Desktop to Embedded
- Add a sizeof and getters/setters for each opaque struct type.
- Add a "end poll" event and function. On 3ds pay mind that software keyboard should be taken account of.
- (Wii) GameCube controller support.
- Make "setNative" alloc non-native buffers if false is specified and buffers are null.
- (Wii) Add TextInput support for it.
- (Wii) add mouse support.
- Add options to disable app termination/loss of focus.
- Replace  SGFE_ASSERT(0) with PANIC.
- Add rumble functionality.
- SGFE_textInputSettingsAssert
- SGFE_bufferAssert
- C++ support.


API-breaking changes:
- change standard format to RGB instead of RGBA
- Use bitwise to denote features instead of ranges.


Documentation:
- event_queue | move the explanation from basic.c to it
- callbacks | make it more in-depth
- window-state
- example on ticks/platform functions
- README.md guide on creating a console backend.
- Document all macros.
- Document all examples.
- Document examples/README.md
- add a gyro example.
- (3DS) Add documentation for OpenGL support and how it requires GLASS and a forked
version of libctru.
- Add an example where the "non-primary" screen is only used.
- split basic.c into multiple examples.
- finish custom-backend example
- Document all SGFE_<PLATFORM> macros.
- Create a screenshot of SGFE working on Wii and 3DS emulators/real hardware.
- swapInterval example
- Add an OpenGL hint that'd force SGFE to create a strict format (warnings become errors?).
- Guide on building for each platform.
- port over examples from RGFW
- create READMEs for each example? for each one mention on which platforms the example works
- example info.c:
    1. print_controller_info of examples/basic.c
    2. SGFE_system functions
    3. SGFE_video functions
- rework README.Md

Bugs:
- (3DS) Fix flicker when opening standard buffer.
- (3DS) Fix flicker when closing basic buffer.
- (Wii) Fix bug where nunchuk controllers are eligible for gyroscope support.
- (3DS) initial text length bug for software keyboard (see text-input.c)


Build system:
- Update Makefiles to be better, have a 'compile_examples' command.



Maybe TODOs:
- (3DS) Find a way to not use gfxInitDefault for GLASS.
- Knob?
- Add angle to sensor.
- Replace wpad code with wiiuse.
- (Wii) Add a "fade out" effect when exiting.
- Make an SDL-style library that'd combine SGFE and RGFW.
- (Wii) White/black/red/blue Wiis as "system models"? Or maybe base it on this: https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2650/~/what-is-the-difference-between-the-models-of-wii-consoles%3F
- Make private API functions visible in the platform section.
- UIApplicationMain & example.
- Make a CHANGELOG
- GitHub actions test for all platforms.
- make it so that when compiling gles1 or multipl-scre/gles1 the shader gets recompiled.
- Implement buffer setters/getters for opengl (resolution). Or maybe don't because
opengl already provides that?
- (3DS) replace "hidScanInput" with raw events.
- Booleans to indicate if system supports certain OpenGL hints that aren't already
provided by glGetInteger (SSAA/downscale)
- test GLASS fps controller example on real hardware/azahar.
- (3DS) aptSetSleepAllowed/aptIsSleepAllowed and aptSetHomeAllowed/aptIsHomeAllowed
- (3DS) see if it's possible to implement and remove 3dsx.specs
- (3DS) implement opengl hints
- (Wii) replace wiikeyboard with a custom implementation.

Distant TODO:
- Create a portable stdout/stderr library that'd write the text on screen.


Planned backends:
- DS (maybe)
- GameCube (maybe)
- Dreamcast (would like to but cannot due to lack of hardware)


Console library TODO:
- Create a console structure that creates its own context and renders on top of the user output.
- Make it creatable/independent of SGFE_window and of createWindow init function.
- use the system font if possible.
- make library compatible with opengl/native APIs
